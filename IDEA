Mission 2: Factions
	- Each faction owns "tiles"
	- kinda like some sort of roguelike-meets-reality

Even better idea:
	- Finishing mission 1 grants you access to a secret cwru club/society
	- Once X people finish mission 1, they get told (via a note on their dorm door) that of the X agents in mission 2,
		enough qr codes for only Y of them to find have been hidden around campus.
